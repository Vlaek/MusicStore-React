Produced by the band with Olsen Involtini, the album was unplanned and recorded as a result of the band\'s tour being postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. According to the band, the enforced lockdowns due to the pandemic spurred the band\'s creativity, resulting in spontaneous writing and recording sessions. Rammstein recorded the album in late 2020 and early 2021 at La Fabrique Studios in Saint-Rémy-de-Provence, France, where they recorded their previous album. The album\'s title track was released as the lead single on 10 March 2022.',
